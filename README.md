# Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR)

GWR offers a localized modeling approach, fitting regression equations to each point in the DataFrame. This project delves into understanding and predicting the spatial distribution of 911 emergency calls using GWR within the ArcGIS framework.

## Project Overview

This collaborative project was conducted with fellow BS GIS students—Waleed, Rana & Afsheen— at Arid University. It was part of our Geo-Statistics assignment, where each team member explored different locations using various methodologies. My focus lay on analyzing 911 emergency call data.

## Research Focus

The central research question was: How do localized socio-demographic factors influence the spatial distribution of 911 emergency calls?

## Methodology

By leveraging Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR), this analysis aimed to unravel the complex spatial relationships between various socio-demographic, environmental, and infrastructural factors and the patterns of 911 emergency calls. The investigation included exploratory data analysis, correlation and collinearity tests, and spatial autocorrelation assessments of the GWR outputs utilizing Moran's I.

## Conclusion

The combined analyses of OLS regression and GWR provide a comprehensive understanding of the diverse factors influencing 911 emergency calls. These insights are crucial for tailored interventions, resource allocation, and strategic planning to enhance emergency services at both broader and localized geographical scales.
